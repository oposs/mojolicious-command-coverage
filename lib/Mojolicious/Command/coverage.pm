=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Command::coverage - Run your application with coverage statistics

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Usage: APPLICATION coverage [OPTIONS] [APPLICATION_OPTIONS]

    ./myapp.pl coverage [application arguments]

    Options:
    -h, --help                Shows this help
    -c, --cover-args <args>   Options for Devel::Cover
    -d, --deanon-args <args>  Options for Devel::Deanonymize (set to 0 to disable Devel::Deanonymize)

    Application Options
    - All parameters not matching [OPTIONS] are forwarded to the mojo application


=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Starts your mojo application with L<Devel::Cover> and optionally L<Devel::Deanonymize>. In short this command does the following:

    ./myapp.pl coverage [application arguments]
    # Is translated to
    perl -I $INC[0] ... - I $INC[N] -MDevel::Cover=$coverageConfig -MDevel::Deanonymize=$deanonConfig myapp.pl [application arguments]


=cut

=head1 USAGE

Runtime configuration for both modules are either passed through the command-line arguments or by specifying
 C<has> sections in your application:

    has coverageConfig => sub{
        return "-ignore,t/,+ignore,prove,+ignore,thirdparty/,-coverage,statement,branch,condition,path,subroutine";
    };

    has deanonymizeConfig => sub {
        return "<Include-pattern>"
    };

If both are present, command-line args are preferred. If none of them are present, we fall-back to these default values:

=over 1

=item Devel::Cover

C<-ignore,t/,-coverage,statement,branch,condition,path,subroutine>

=item Devel::Deanonymize

C<ref $self->app> ( -> Resolves to your application name)

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

    # (with `has` sections or default config)
    ./myapp.pl coverage daemon --listen "http://*:8888"

    # (with args)
    ./myapp.pl coverage -d MyPattern* daemon --listen "http://*:8888"
